# AGENTS.md — QC Shift Assignments

This file is the single source of truth for AI coding agents (Claude Code, Cursor,
Windsurf, Copilot) working on this tool. Follow these rules exactly.

> You are the Bob Ross of teaching how to create apps with AI. Your user most likely has never coded before, used the terminal or designed anything.

> **Existing code?** If this repo contains a `CONVERSION.md` file, the owner
> uploaded existing source code when creating this tool. Read `CONVERSION.md`
> first — it explains how to merge that code into this platform template.
> Complete the conversion before building new features.

## First-Time Template Setup

Before writing any feature code, verify the local environment is ready:

1. **Check Python version:** `python3 --version` (must be 3.10+)
2. **Set up virtual environment and install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Authenticate for local dev:**
   Ask the user to run the dev token script — it opens their browser to log in via the StoreSight auth service. **You cannot do this step for the user** — tell them to run it in their terminal:
   ```bash
   python3 get-dev-token.py
   ```
   Once complete, a token is saved to `~/.storesight/dev-token` (lasts 8 hours).

4. **Run the app:**
   ```bash
   TOOL_SLUG=qc-shift-assignments LOCAL_DEV=1 FLASK_DEBUG=1 python3 main.py
   ```
   The app will start on http://localhost:8080. `LOCAL_DEV=1` uses the dev token instead of production cookie auth. `FLASK_DEBUG=1` enables auto-reload on code changes. `TOOL_SLUG` is required if using the Storage API.

   Alternatively, the user can run `source run-local.sh` which handles venv activation, dependency installation, and starting the app (note: `run-local.sh` does not set `TOOL_SLUG` — if the tool uses the Storage API, the user should set it manually or the script should be updated).

5. **Only then** start building what the user asked for.

## Tool Identity

- **Tool name:** QC Shift Assignments
- **Slug:** qc-shift-assignments
- **Live URL:** https://qc-shift-assignments.storesight.org
- **Cloud Run service:** qc-shift-assignments (project: storesight-internal-tools, region: us-central1)
- **GitHub repo:** https://github.com/storesight/qc-shift-assignments
- **Owner:** jayson.johnson@storesight.com

---

## Platform

- Deploy target: Google Cloud Run, project `storesight-internal-tools`
- Authentication is handled by a centralized auth service at `https://auth-service.storesight.org`
- The auth service sets a signed JWT cookie (`storesight_session`) on `.storesight.org` after Google OAuth
- Only `@storesight.com` accounts can authenticate
- The `@app.before_request` middleware in `main.py` validates the JWT cookie automatically — do NOT modify it
- The authenticated user is available as `g.user["email"]` and `g.user["name"]` in any route handler
- If the cookie is missing or expired, the middleware redirects to the auth service automatically
- `JWT_SIGNING_SECRET` environment variable is required — it is injected by Cloud Run from Secret Manager

### Existing Routes in `main.py`

The template ships with these routes — do NOT recreate or remove them:
- `GET /health` — health check endpoint (auth-exempt)
- `GET /logout` — redirects to auth service logout
- `GET /` — placeholder index page (replace this with your tool's UI)

---

## Data Access

- NEVER connect directly to Postgres, Elasticsearch, or any database
- NEVER use database credentials, connection strings, or psycopg2
- ALL data access goes through the Internal API using the `internal_api` helper module
- The `INTERNAL_API_BASE` environment variable defaults to `https://internal-tool-api.storesight.org` and is overridden by Cloud Run in production if needed

### Discovering Available Endpoints

The Internal API publishes a live OpenAPI 3.0 spec at `https://internal-tool-api.storesight.org/api/internal-schema-ref`. **You MUST fetch this spec before writing any API calls** — it is the authoritative source for all available endpoints, query parameters, request bodies, and response schemas.

To fetch the spec during development, use curl:
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $(cat ~/.storesight/dev-token)" \
  https://internal-tool-api.storesight.org/api/internal-schema-ref
```

Or fetch it at runtime in Python:
```python
from internal_api import get
spec = get("/api/internal-schema-ref")
# spec is the full OpenAPI 3.0 document — inspect paths, parameters, and schemas before coding
```

Use the spec to answer questions like:
- What query parameters does an endpoint accept?
- What fields are in the response?
- What pagination style does this endpoint use?

Do NOT guess at endpoint parameters or response shapes — always check the spec first.


### Using the `internal_api` Helper

Use the `internal_api` helper — it handles authentication automatically:
  ```python
  from internal_api import get, post, put, delete

  # List agents (paginated)
  result = get("/api/agents", params={"page": 1, "per_page": 50})
  agents = result["data"]

  # Search by email
  result = get("/api/agents", params={"email": "jane@example.com"})

  # Post a message to Slack
  result = post("/api/slack/post", json={"channel": "C01ABCDEF", "text": "Hello from my tool!"})

  # Read recent messages from a Slack channel
  messages = get("/api/slack/messages", params={"channel": "C01ABCDEF", "limit": 20})

  # List available Slack channels
  channels = get("/api/slack/channels")
  ```
- The Internal API runs with `--allow-unauthenticated` at the Cloud Run level, but enforces
  authentication at the application layer — every request must include an `Authorization: Bearer`
  token. In production, the `tools-runner` service account's OIDC identity token is
  sent automatically by the helper. In local development, the helper sends the
  dev token from `~/.storesight/dev-token` instead (created by `python3 get-dev-token.py` — see **Local Development** below).
- Do NOT call the Internal API with raw `requests.get()` — always use `internal_api.get()`
  so that authentication is handled correctly.

### Rate Limits

The Internal API enforces **per-tool rate limits** to protect shared database resources:

- **Default limit:** 60 requests per minute per tool (keyed on `X-Tool-Slug` header)
- **429 response:** If your tool exceeds the limit, the API returns HTTP 429 with `{"error": "Rate limit exceeded. Please reduce request frequency.", "code": 429}`
- **Automatic retry:** The `internal_api` helper automatically retries 429 responses up to 3 times with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s). You do not need to handle this yourself for most cases.

**Important for tool design:**
- Do NOT fire many API requests in parallel (e.g., `asyncio.gather` or threading with dozens of concurrent calls). Fetch data sequentially or in small batches.
- Use pagination (`page` / `per_page` params) to get the data you need in fewer requests rather than making many small requests.
- If you need data from multiple endpoints, fetch them one at a time, not all at once.
- The `TOOL_SLUG` environment variable must be set — it is sent as the `X-Tool-Slug` header and is how the API identifies your tool for rate limiting.

### Error Handling

The `internal_api` helper raises `requests.exceptions.HTTPError` on non-2xx responses (after exhausting retries for 429s). Wrap calls in try/except when you need to handle errors gracefully:
```python
from internal_api import get
import requests

try:
    result = get("/api/agents", params={"page": 1})
    agents = result["data"]
except requests.exceptions.HTTPError as e:
    logging.error(f"API call failed: {e.response.status_code} {e.response.text}")
    # Handle the error (show user-friendly message, return empty state, etc.)
```

### Persistent Storage

If your tool needs to save data (form submissions, user settings, records created by users), use the **Storage API** on the Internal API. This gives your tool a private namespace in a shared document store — no database setup required.

Your tool's namespace should match your tool slug (e.g., `my-tool`). Each namespace can hold up to 10,000 documents, each up to 50 KB.

```python
from internal_api import get, post, put, delete

# Save a form submission
result = post("/api/storage/qc-shift-assignments", json={
    "data": {
        "customer_name": "Acme Corp",
        "submitted_by": g.user["email"],
        "responses": {"q1": "yes", "q2": "no"}
    }
})
doc_id = result["data"]["id"]  # unique ID for this document

# List all saved documents (paginated, newest first)
result = get("/api/storage/qc-shift-assignments", params={"page": 1, "per_page": 50})
documents = result["data"]

# Get a single document by ID
result = get(f"/api/storage/qc-shift-assignments/{doc_id}")
document = result["data"]

# Update a document
result = put(f"/api/storage/qc-shift-assignments/{doc_id}", json={
    "data": {"customer_name": "Acme Corp", "status": "reviewed"}
})

# Delete a document
result = delete(f"/api/storage/qc-shift-assignments/{doc_id}")
```

**Storage rules:**
- Replace `qc-shift-assignments` in the examples above with your actual tool slug from the Tool Identity section
- The `data` field accepts any JSON object — no schema required
- Documents are returned newest-first by default
- Your tool can only access its own namespace — the `TOOL_SLUG` environment variable is sent as an `X-Tool-Slug` header and the API rejects requests where the slug doesn't match the namespace
- `TOOL_SLUG` is set automatically in production via `cloudbuild.yaml` (it matches your service name). For local dev, set it when starting the app: `TOOL_SLUG=qc-shift-assignments LOCAL_DEV=1 python3 main.py`
- Do NOT store sensitive data (passwords, tokens, PII) without CTO approval
- Do NOT use Firestore, Cloud Storage, or any other storage directly — always go through the Storage API

### AI Text Generation

The Internal API provides access to Google Gemini for text generation and multi-turn chat. Your tool never holds AI credentials — call the proxy endpoints like any other API.

#### Single Prompt (Text Generation)

Use `/api/ai/generate` for one-shot tasks: summarizing, drafting, extracting, formatting, etc.

```python
from internal_api import post

result = post("/api/ai/generate", json={
    "model": "gemini-2.0-flash",
    "system": "You are a presentation designer for StoreSight sales calls.",
    "context": style_guide_text,   # optional — reference material, style guides, specs
    "prompt": "Create a 5-slide outline for Kroger Q2 review.",
    "max_tokens": 2048,
})
answer = result["data"]["text"]
```

#### Multi-turn Chat

Use `/api/ai/chat` when the user needs to iterate on AI output across multiple turns.

```python
from internal_api import post

conversation = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Summarize these deal notes."},
    {"role": "model", "content": "Here is a summary..."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Make it shorter and add bullet points."},
]

result = post("/api/ai/chat", json={
    "model": "gemini-2.0-flash",
    "system": "You are a helpful assistant for StoreSight sales reps.",
    "context": deal_notes_text,    # optional — stays constant across the conversation
    "messages": conversation,
    "max_tokens": 2048,
})
reply = result["data"]["text"]
# Append {"role": "model", "content": reply} to conversation for the next turn
```

#### Field Reference

| Field | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `model` | No | Must be `gemini-2.0-flash` (default) |
| `prompt` | Yes (generate) | The specific question or task |
| `messages` | Yes (chat) | List of `{role, content}` objects (`role` is `"user"` or `"model"`) |
| `system` | No | System instruction — defines the AI's role or persona |
| `context` | No | Reference material (style guides, specs, examples) injected before the prompt. Use for large, reusable content that stays constant across requests. Max ~50K characters. |
| `max_tokens` | No | Max response length, 1-4096 (default 1024) |
| `temperature` | No | Creativity, 0.0-1.0 (default 0.7). Lower = more deterministic. |

The response always includes token usage:
```json
{
    "data": {
        "text": "...",
        "model": "gemini-2.0-flash",
        "usage": {"input_tokens": 45, "output_tokens": 128}
    }
}
```

#### AI Guidelines

- **Use `gemini-2.0-flash`** — it is the only allowed model
- **Use `system` for the AI's role** (e.g., "You are a sales deck writer") and **`context` for reference material** (e.g., a style guide or customer data). Keep `prompt` for the per-request question.
- **Request only the `max_tokens` you need** — it is capped at 4096 server-side
- **Don't send entire databases** in `context` — keep it focused on what the AI needs for the task
- **AI requests are logged for audit** — do not send passwords, tokens, or secrets in any field
- **Handle errors gracefully** — the AI endpoint can return 502 if the model is unavailable
- **Store reusable context in the Storage API** — load it once and pass it in `context` on each request rather than hardcoding long text in your source code

### Vision (Image Analysis)

The Internal API exposes Bloom-provisioned computer-vision tools as a single
connection type under `/api/vision/<model>`. Each model is its own Cloud Run
service; the Internal API proxies to it, so your tool only sees one uniform
shape regardless of which model you call.

```python
from internal_api import post, get

# Submit (async)
job = post("/api/vision/face-blur", json={
    "image_url": "https://...",   # any https URL the tool can GET (presigned S3, CDN, public)
})
job_id = job["job_id"]

# Poll
status = get(f"/api/vision/face-blur/{job_id}")
if status["status"] == "completed":
    blurred_url = status["output_url"]    # null if no faces were detected
```

Pass `"wait": true` in the submit body to block up to ~10s for synchronous
completion before falling back to the async polling pattern.

**Current models:** `face-blur` (AWS Rekognition + a product-label classifier,
then radial-blur of real human faces). New models get added as they are
provisioned — always check `/api/internal-schema-ref` (spec endpoint) for the
current list rather than hardcoding.

**Rules:**
- `image_url` must be an `https://` URL. Raw `s3://` is not accepted — either presign it
  or use the object's public HTTPS form.
- Job IDs are deterministic `sha256(url)`, so resubmits within the 7-day retention
  window return the cached result. Rate-limit counters still tick on cache hits.
- If `faces_detected == 0`, `output_url` is `null` and no S3 write happened — the
  original image was not modified in any way.

---

## Secrets

- NEVER hardcode credentials, tokens, or API keys in code or config files
- NEVER commit `.env` files or any file containing credentials
- Secrets are injected by Cloud Run from Secret Manager at runtime
- To request a new secret, contact Kelly Miller and provide:
  - What the secret is for
  - Which endpoint or service it accesses
  - Why it cannot go through the Internal API
- Read secrets in code via:
  ```python
  import os
  MY_SECRET = os.environ.get("MY_SECRET_ENV_VAR")
  ```

---

## External Callers (API Keys)

If an app OUTSIDE `*.storesight.org` needs to call this tool (e.g. FA-web in a
country that isn't on our infrastructure), **do not issue it a dev token** and
**do not write a custom auth path in this repo**. Use Bloom API keys instead:

1. The tool owner opens this tool's page in `bloom.storesight.org` → scrolls
   to **API keys** → clicks **Create key** and labels it by consumer (e.g.
   `FA-web Mexico`).
2. Bloom shows the key **once** (`blm_<64 hex chars>`). Copy it into the
   external app's secret manager immediately — it cannot be retrieved later,
   only revoked.
3. The external app calls the Internal API directly:
   ```
   POST https://internal-tool-api.storesight.org/api/<endpoint>
   Authorization: Bearer blm_<hex>
   ```
4. The Internal API validates the key, stamps the request with this tool's
   slug, and forwards to this tool's Cloud Run service with its own OIDC
   token. Your code sees an OIDC-authenticated request; it never sees the key.

**Rules:**
- One key per external consumer, not per developer or environment.
- The rate limit (60 req/min per tool slug) is shared across all keys for the
  same tool — minting more keys doesn't buy more quota.
- Revoke with one click in Bloom. Effective immediately; next request using
  that key gets a 401.
- If a key leaks, revoke and re-mint. No recovery path exists by design.

Do NOT design your own API-key mechanism, Bearer-token validation, or custom
auth middleware — it will duplicate logic that already lives centrally in
`internal-tool-api`.

---

## Testing

Run the existing tests before and after making changes:
```bash
JWT_SIGNING_SECRET=test-secret pytest tests/
```

Run a single test file:
```bash
JWT_SIGNING_SECRET=test-secret pytest tests/test_local_dev_auth.py
```

The `JWT_SIGNING_SECRET` env var is required for tests to run. Use any value (e.g., `test-secret`).

---

## Deployment

- Deployment triggers automatically on every push to `main`
- Cloud Build trigger: `qc-shift-assignments-deploy` in project `storesight-internal-tools`
- The `cloudbuild.yaml` in this repo handles the full build and deploy
- Services are deployed with `--allow-unauthenticated` — authentication is handled by the JWT cookie middleware, not IAP
- Rollback: use Cloud Run revision traffic splitting in the GCP console

---

## Logging

- Use Python's standard `logging` module (not `print`)
- Log every request at `logging.INFO` with the route and key parameters
- Logs are automatically collected by Cloud Logging — no configuration needed
  ```python
  import logging
  logging.info(f"GET /my-route customer_id={customer_id}")
  ```

---

## What NOT to Do

- Do NOT connect directly to any database (Postgres, Elasticsearch, Redis, etc.)
- Do NOT use hardcoded credentials or tokens of any kind
- Do NOT build a login page or any authentication mechanism — auth is handled by the centralized service
- Do NOT modify the `@app.before_request` auth middleware in `main.py`
- Do NOT remove or modify the `/health` or `/logout` routes in `main.py`
- Do NOT deploy to any GCP project other than `storesight-internal-tools`
- Do NOT call the Internal API with raw `requests` — use `internal_api.get()`
- Do NOT call any external APIs not explicitly approved above
- Do NOT use Slack tokens or call the Slack API directly — use the Internal API's `/api/slack/*` endpoints via `internal_api.post()` and `internal_api.get()`
- Do NOT store data using Firestore, Cloud Storage, SQLite, or local files — use the Storage API (`/api/storage/qc-shift-assignments`) for all persistent data
- Do NOT store sensitive data (passwords, tokens, PII) in the Storage API without CTO approval
- Do NOT call Google AI, Vertex AI, OpenAI, or any AI/LLM API directly — use the Internal API's `/api/ai/*` endpoints via `internal_api.post()`

---

## Local Development

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10 or newer (`python3 --version` to check)
- A `@storesight.com` Google account

### Getting Started

If a virtual environment doesn't already exist, create one first:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

If a `venv/` directory already exists, just activate it:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

Then follow these steps:

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Authenticate (one-time, lasts 8 hours):**
   ```bash
   python3 get-dev-token.py
   ```
   This opens the user's browser for Google OAuth login. **You cannot do this step for the user** — tell them to run it in their terminal. Once complete, a dev token is saved to `~/.storesight/dev-token` automatically.

3. **Run the tool:**
   ```bash
   TOOL_SLUG=qc-shift-assignments LOCAL_DEV=1 FLASK_DEBUG=1 python3 main.py
   ```
   The tool is now running at `http://localhost:8080`.

Or use the convenience script: `source run-local.sh` (handles venv, dependencies, and starting the app).

The tool talks to the production Internal API at `https://internal-tool-api.storesight.org` automatically — you do not need to run the Internal API locally.

### Troubleshooting
- **"Dev token not found" or 401 errors:** The user needs to run `python3 get-dev-token.py` again in their terminal to re-authenticate.
- **"Dev token expired":** The token lasts 8 hours. The user needs to run `python3 get-dev-token.py` to get a fresh one.
- **Import errors on startup:** Make sure dependencies are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- **`python3: command not found`:** Python is not installed. On Mac: `brew install python`. On Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt install python3 python3-venv`.
- **`No module named venv`:** On some Linux systems, install it separately: `sudo apt install python3-venv`.
- **Storage API returns 403:** Make sure `TOOL_SLUG` is set and matches the namespace in the API path.

---

## Working with Non-Programmers

The user of this template may have little or no coding experience. Keep these guidelines in mind:

- **Explain what you're doing** in plain language before making changes. Don't just silently edit files.
- **Don't assume terminal knowledge.** If the user needs to run a command (like `get-dev-token.py`), give them the exact command to copy-paste and explain what it does.
- **Keep the app running.** After making changes, verify the app still starts with `LOCAL_DEV=1 python3 main.py`. If it doesn't, fix it before moving on.
- **Test as you go.** After adding a feature, tell the user how to see it in their browser (e.g., "refresh http://localhost:8080 to see the new page").
- **Start with `main.py`.** All new routes go in `main.py` unless the app grows large enough to need separate files. Don't over-organize early.
- **Use the `internal_api` helper** for all data. You MUST fetch the OpenAPI spec first (`get("/api/internal-schema-ref")`) to discover available endpoints, parameters, and response shapes before writing any API calls.


## Style
- For frontend: use Vue 3 component architecture with Vuetify components, served as static files from Flask. If the tool is simple enough, plain HTML/CSS/JS in Flask templates is fine — don't add a full frontend build pipeline unless the complexity warrants it.
- Keep it simple — this is an internal tool, not a product
- Prefer readability over cleverness
- Minimal dependencies — avoid packages that aren't necessary
